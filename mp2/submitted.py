This is the module you'll submit to the autograder.

There are several function definitions, here, that raise RuntimeErrors.  You should replace
each "raise RuntimeError" line with a line that performs the function specified in the
function's docstring.

def smooth_video(x, sigma, L):
    '''
    y = smooth_video(x, sigma, L)
    Smooth the video using a sampled-Gaussian smoothing kernel.

    x (TxRxC) - a video with T frames, R rows, C columns
    sigma (scalar) - standard deviation of the Gaussian smoothing kernel
    L (scalar) - length of the Gaussian smoothing kernel
    y (TxRxC) - the same video, smoothed in the row and column directions.

    Compute gradients using a first-order central finite difference.

    gr (TxRxC) - gradient in the vertical direction

    H (scalar) - height (in rows) of each optical flow block
    W (scalar) - width (in columns) of each optical flow block

    vr (Txint(R/H)xint(C/W)) - pixel velocity in vertical direction
    vc (Txint(R/H)xint(C/W)) - pixel velocity in horizontal direction

def medianfilt(x, H, W):

    y = medianfilt(x, H, W)
    Median-filter the video, x, in HxW blocks.

    x (TxRxC) - a video with T frames, R rows, C columns
    H (scalar) - the height of median-filtering blocks
    C (scalar) - the width of median-filtering blocks
    y (TxRxC) - y[t,r,c] is the median of the pixels x[t,rmin:rmax,cmin:cmax], where

def interpolate(x, U):
    '''
    y = interpolate(x, U)
    Upsample and interpolate an image using bilinear interpolation.

    x (TxRxC) - a video with T frames, R rows, C columns
    U (scalar) - upsampling factor
    y (Tx(U*R)x(U*C)) - interpolated image

    delta = scale_velocities(v, U)
    Scale the velocities in v by a factor of U,
    then quantize them to the nearest integer.
    
    v (TxRxC) - T frames, each is an RxC velocity image
    U (scalar) - an upsampling factor
    delta (TxRxC) - integers closest to v*U

def velocity_fill(x, vr, vc, keep):
    '''
    y = velocity_fill(x, vr, vc, keep)
    Fill in missing frames by copying samples with a shift given by the velocity vector.

    x (T,R,C) - a video signal in which most frames are zero
    vr (T,Ra,Cb) - the vertical velocity field, integer-valued
    vc (T,Ra,Cb) - the horizontal velocity field, integer-valued
        Notice that Ra and Cb might be less than R and C.  If they are, the remaining samples 
        of y should just be copied from y[t-1,r,c].
    keep (array) -  a list of frames that should be kept.  Every frame not in this list is
     replaced by samples copied from the preceding frame.

    y (T,R,C) - a copy of x, with the missing frames filled in.
